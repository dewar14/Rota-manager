# Critical Updates Required for Medical Rota System

## 1. FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE CHANGES

### Time Horizon Extension (CRITICAL)
- **Current**: 14-day test periods  
- **Required**: 6-month (26-week) periods
- **Impact**: All constraint calculations, memory usage, solve times

### Data Model Expansion
- **Missing**: Leave allowances (14/15/17 days), requested leave dates
- **Missing**: Training day scheduling integration  
- **Missing**: School holiday handling (Nottinghamshire)
- **Missing**: WTE-based hour calculations (42-47 hours * WTE)

## 2. CONSTRAINT IMPLEMENTATION GAPS

### Hard Constraints (Must Fix)
✅ Max 72 hours in 168-hour period - EXISTS  
✅ 46-hour rest after nights - EXISTS  
❌ **Maximum 1 in 2 weekends** - MISSING  
❌ **Maximum 4 consecutive long shifts** - MISSING  
❌ **Maximum 4 consecutive nights (min 2)** - PARTIAL  
❌ **Maximum 7 consecutive shifts** - MISSING  
❌ **Fairness ±25% for nights/long days/weekends** - MISSING  

### Firm Constraints (Should Fix)
❌ **Maximum 1 in 3 weekends** - MISSING  
❌ **No consecutive night blocks** - MISSING  
❌ **Weekend continuity (Sat+Sun)** - MISSING  
❌ **Training day fairness ±33%** - MISSING  

## 3. STAFFING REQUIREMENTS GAPS

### Daily Coverage (CRITICAL)
- **Current**: Basic COMET night assignment only
- **Required**: Full daily staffing for all shift types
  - 1 Long Day Registrar + 1 Long Day SHO  
  - 1 Night Registrar + 1 Night SHO
  - 1-3 Short Day doctors (weekdays)
  - COMET coverage on alternate weeks

### Grade-Based Assignment  
- **Missing**: Proper SHO vs Registrar enforcement
- **Missing**: COMET eligibility validation
- **Missing**: Training day grade requirements

## 4. USER INTERFACE MISSING COMPONENTS

### Input Interface
❌ **6-month time horizon selection**  
❌ **COMET week pattern configuration**  
❌ **Bank holiday date input**  
❌ **Training day scheduling**  
❌ **Leave request management**  
❌ **Doctor WTE and eligibility management**

### Output Interface  
❌ **Color-coded rota table** (Red=nights, Green=long days, etc.)
❌ **Daily staffing tallies**  
❌ **Doctor statistics summary** (hours/week, shift counts)
❌ **Constraint violation reporting**
❌ **Manual override capability**

## 5. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY ISSUES

### Solver Scalability
- **Current**: Optimized for 14-day periods
- **Challenge**: 26-week periods = ~182 days = 13x larger problem space
- **Risk**: Exponential increase in solve time/memory

### Solution Architecture
- **Current**: Single-stage OR-Tools solver
- **Needed**: Multi-stage approach with checkpoint recovery
- **Needed**: Incremental solving capability

## 6. PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)
1. **Extend time horizon to 6 months**
2. **Implement missing hard constraints**  
3. **Add proper daily staffing requirements**
4. **Create comprehensive data input interface**

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)  
5. **Add color-coded rota output with statistics**
6. **Implement firm constraints and preferences**
7. **Add manual override and re-solve capability**
8. **Performance optimization for 6-month periods**

### Phase 3: Polish & Integration (1-2 weeks)
9. **Advanced fairness algorithms**
10. **Comprehensive constraint violation reporting**
11. **Export capabilities (Excel, PDF)**
12. **User testing and refinement**

## 7. IMMEDIATE CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED

```python
# 1. Update Config model for 6-month horizon
class Config(BaseModel):
    start_date: dt.date  # Should span 6 months
    end_date: dt.date    # start_date + 26 weeks
    
    # Add missing required fields
    leave_allowances: Dict[str, int]  # person_id -> days
    requested_leave: Dict[str, List[dt.date]]  # person_id -> dates
    
# 2. Add missing constraint functions
def max_consecutive_long_shifts_constraint(model, x, people, days):
    # Maximum 4 consecutive long shifts + 48h rest
    
def max_consecutive_any_shifts_constraint(model, x, people, days):  
    # Maximum 7 consecutive shifts + 48h rest
    
def weekend_frequency_constraint(model, x, people, days):
    # Maximum 1 in 2 weekends (hard), 1 in 3 (firm)

# 3. Add proper daily staffing requirements
def daily_staffing_requirements(model, x, people, days):
    # Exactly 1 of each required shift type per day
    # 1-3 short day doctors on weekdays
```

## 8. ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Database Integration
Consider adding persistent storage for:
- Historical rota data (26-week fairness tracking)
- User preferences and overrides  
- Constraint violation history

### API Restructuring
- Separate endpoints for data input vs solving
- Progress tracking for long-running solves
- Checkpoint/resume capability for manual interventions

### Performance Strategy  
- Implement staged solving (current approach is good start)
- Add timeout handling and partial solutions
- Consider approximation algorithms for initial solutions

**CRITICAL PATH**: The current system handles 14-day toy problems. To fulfill the medical rota purpose, items 1-4 above must be completed before the system can be used in production.
