## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Time Horizon Scaling (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Current**: 14-day test periods
- **Required**: 6-month (26-week) periods = 182 days
- **Impact**: 13x increase in problem complexity
- **Risk**: Solver may timeout or run out of memory

### 2. **Missing Hard Constraints (CRITICAL)**
```python
# These constraints are missing or incomplete:
- Maximum 1 in 2 weekends worked (hard constraint)
- Maximum 4 consecutive long shifts + 48h rest
- Maximum 7 consecutive shifts + 48h rest  
- Fairness ¬±25% for nights/long days/weekends per WTE
- Proper grade-based assignment enforcement
```

### 3. **Daily Staffing Requirements (CRITICAL)**
- **Current**: Only COMET night assignment
- **Required**: Full daily coverage
  - 1 Long Day Registrar + 1 Long Day SHO
  - 1 Night Registrar + 1 Night SHO  
  - 1-3 Short Day doctors (weekdays)
  - COMET coverage on alternate weeks

### 4. **Missing Output Components**
- **Color-coded rota table**: Night=red, Long Day=green, etc.
- **Daily staffing tallies**: How many clinicians per day
- **Doctor statistics**: Hours/week, shift counts, fairness metrics
- **Constraint violations**: Which rules were broken and why

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (2-3 weeks)
1. **Implement missing hard constraints**
   - Weekend frequency (1 in 2, 1 in 3)
   - Consecutive shift limits (4 long, 7 any)
   - Proper rest periods (48h after sequences)

2. **Add daily staffing requirements**
   - Core operational shift coverage
   - Grade-specific assignment validation
   - COMET eligibility enforcement

3. **Scale to 6-month periods**
   - Test solver performance with 182-day problems
   - Implement timeout handling and partial solutions
   - Memory optimization for large problem instances

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
4. **Complete output system**
   - Color-coded rota visualization
   - Daily staffing statistics
   - Comprehensive doctor workload analysis
   - Constraint violation reporting

5. **Fairness algorithms**
   - WTE-adjusted fairness calculations
   - Historical tracking over 26-week periods
   - ¬±15% and ¬±25% variance constraints

6. **Manual override system**
   - Admin ability to fix specific assignments
   - Re-solve with locked assignments
   - Partial solve continuation

### Phase 3: Production Ready (1-2 weeks)
7. **Performance optimization**
   - Heuristic initialization for large problems
   - Staged solving with intelligent backtracking
   - Approximation algorithms for impossible instances

8. **Data persistence**
   - Database integration for historical data
   - Save/load rota configurations
   - Audit trail for manual changes

9. **Export and integration**
   - Excel export with proper formatting
   - PDF generation with color coding
   - API integration for external systems

## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Test Current System with 6-Month Data
```bash
# Update test to use 6-month configuration
python test_checkpoints.py --config=data/medical_rota_6month.yml
```

### 2. Implement Missing Hard Constraints
```python
# Priority order for constraint implementation:
1. Weekend frequency constraints (1 in 2, 1 in 3)
2. Consecutive shift limits (4 long, 7 any)
3. Proper daily staffing requirements
4. Grade-based assignment validation
5. Fairness variance constraints (¬±15%, ¬±25%)
```

### 3. Scale Testing
- Test with realistic 26-week periods
- Monitor solve times and memory usage
- Implement timeout handling and partial solutions

## üí° ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables for production system
CREATE TABLE rotas (id, name, start_date, end_date, status);
CREATE TABLE doctors (id, name, grade, wte, comet_eligible);
CREATE TABLE assignments (rota_id, doctor_id, date, shift_type);
CREATE TABLE constraints_violations (rota_id, type, description);
```

### Performance Strategy
- **Incremental solving**: Build roster week by week
- **Constraint relaxation**: Start strict, relax if infeasible
- **Heuristic seeding**: Use previous rotas as starting points
- **Parallel processing**: Solve independent weeks simultaneously
