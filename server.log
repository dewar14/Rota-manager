   Added 8077 SOFT gap constraints (prefer 5 days) across 181 days
   ✅ Gaps <5 days are allowed but penalized - solver has more flexibility
   Added 702 WEEKEND PATTERN bonuses (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   ✅ Weekend blocks (Fri-Sat-Sun, Fri-Sat-Sun-Mon, Thu-Fri-Sat-Sun) strongly incentivized
   ⚠️  Skipping 72-hour weekly max constraints (problem size: 181 days)
      Will be checked post-solve in constraint validator
   🎯 'Good enough' stopping: Will stop at 5% from optimal (faster results)
   ⏳ Solving with CP-SAT (timeout: 300s)...
